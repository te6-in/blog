# Project Overview

This is a personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). The blog is designed to be a platform for sharing articles and code snippets related to software development and design. It is built with a focus on performance, accessibility, and SEO.

## Key Technologies

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: The core framework for building the blog. Astro is a static site generator that allows for building fast websites with a modern developer experience.
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)**: Used for writing content. MDX allows for using React components within Markdown files, which is great for creating rich and interactive content.
- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: Partially used for creating interactive components within the blog UI or the MDX content.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Used for styling the blog. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Used for writing the codebase. TypeScript provides static typing for JavaScript, which helps to prevent errors and improve code quality.

## Architecture

The blog is a static site generated by Astro. The content is stored in a separate `contents` directory, which is a git submodule. This allows the content to be versioned and managed independently of the main codebase. LLMs don't have access to the content directory or repository. The update is done using `git submodule update --remote -- contents` but this shouldn't be done unless requested.

The blog also uses [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for comments (through [giscus](https://giscus.app/)) and to determine "recently engaged" posts. This adds dynamic functionality to a static site.

### Content Collections

All content is stored in the `contents` directory and is organized into the following collections, which are defined in `src/content.config.ts`. The following are the main collections:

- `post`: Blog posts
- `snippet`: Short code snippets
- `series`: A collection of posts and snippets
- `author`: Author information
- `altText`: Alt text for images

#### Alt Text Collection

All images used in the blog should have alt text for accessibility. Please keep in mind that all images that are part of the blog post/snippet should have alt text derived from the alt text collection. This includes images used in the content as well as images used in the metadata (e.g., cover images for Open Graph).

### SEO

The blog is optimized for SEO. It uses the `astro-sitemap` integration to generate a sitemap, and it generates JSON-LD structured data to provide rich snippets in search engine results. The JSON-LD generation is handled in `src/lib/json-ld.ts`.

## Building and Running

The following commands are used to build and run the project:

| Command        | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install` | Installs dependencies                                   |
| `yarn dev`     | Starts the local development server at `localhost:4321` |
| `yarn build`   | Builds the production site to `./dist/`                 |
| `yarn preview` | Previews the build locally, before deploying            |
| `yarn check`   | Runs `biome check --fix` and `astro check`              |

## Development Conventions

### Code

The codebase is written in TypeScript and uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The `astro.config.ts` file contains the main configuration for the Astro project, and the `src/content.config.ts` file defines the content collections.

### Metadata and Lexicons

All site metadata is defined in the `src/lib/metadata.ts` file. This includes the site name, author information, repository information, and social media links. Also, lexicons for various terms used in the blog are defined in the same file. Please always refer to this file rather than hardcoding blog metadata, or terms and phrases used in the blog.
